Hello !

Using OpenCore. (because I'm 2modern4u)

## How to install
# Required thingys

MacOS High Sierra or Mojave image (use GibMacOS)
Make your bootable USB with MakeInstall from GibMacOS

Replace the USB EFI with an EFI folder and take the BOOT / OC from my Ryzentosh build (will be fixed soon)
Replace all OC content from Ryzentosh to the one into this repository

Enjoy
